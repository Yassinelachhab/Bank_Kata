In response to the exercise, I have written two versions of the code: one (TestKataVersion1) that takes the deposit and withdrawal
values by default, and another version (TestKataVersion2) that asks the user for the type of operation they want to
perform (deposit, withdraw, or display executed operations).

      THE result of the first vesion was the following one :

DATE | AMOUNT | BALANCE
31-01-2025 | -300 | 2500
31-01-2025 | 2000 | 3000
31-01-2025 | 1000 | 1000



      AS for the result of the second version was as follows

Enter 'd' to deposit, 'w' to withdraw, 's' to show statement, or 'q' to quit:
